                    <p>Tendo is a soft robotic exoskeleton, imagine a robotic glove, which strengthens your grip. It covers the thumb, index finger and forearm and itâ€™s equipped with soft artificial tendons and smart sensors detecting when you are about to grasp an object and applies the requested strength to your fingers.</p>
                    <p>Tendo creates greater independence for people suffering from limitations due to e.g. arthritis, an injury, stroke or age and results in an improved self-image and quality of life as well as a reduced need of assistance from the community and family. Tendo is worn almost like a glove and enables a strong grip in more or less all everyday situations.</p>
